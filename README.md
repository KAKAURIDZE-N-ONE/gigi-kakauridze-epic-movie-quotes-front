## Introduction
This frontend project is a social website for movie quotes, where users can log in, register, restore their password, or change their password. It also includes Google authentication. Once logged in, users can add movies to their personal movie list and create quotes about those movies. These quotes will appear on the news feed page, where any verified user can like or comment on them. The quote owner receives real-time notifications for likes and comments.

Additionally, users can search for both quotes and movies. They can also update their profile picture, username, and password while logged in. The website supports two languages: Georgian and English.
